Some of the scripts and projects that I have created

Flight Scraper:
The purpose of this project was to get a personalized report that would deliver an email to me daily in order for me to track the prices of flights.
This script has been running smoothly and delivering the results but some ideas for the future enhancements are:
1. Make this more flexible so the user can input origin airport, destination airport, and the dates of travel
2. Add regex to the xpaths since the html id's are dynamic
